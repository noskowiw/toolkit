Keeping these resources provisioned around the clock is very wasteful, as running instances still use up energy even while idling (see utilization). Each type of environment should run on a different schedule. Development environments should only be running during working hours of the development team, test environments should only be running when tests are being performed, and so on.</p><p id="ba177895-00d0-428b-9bb4-9057c8a1d1d5" class="">Practically every cloud provider allows users to utilize some kind of automated lifecycle manager for their environments. In the case of environments that need to be run with inconsistent schedules, on-demand instances can be utilized.</p><p id="17f23fa5-28bd-49ca-8118-93f6c8de4b1a" class="">
