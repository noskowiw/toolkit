Sourcery's automated code analysis and optimization features can help you identify suboptimal fragments of code, avoid resource-intensive code patterns and generally improve your codebase on the most granular level.
These changes make your software more sustainable in two major ways:

- they increase the efficiency of the code you're running therefore making it consume less energy when executed
- they can make your code more standardized, removing the need for future refactoring and allowing your code to more seamlessly integrate into the rest of the codebase

It can be easily integrated into both vscode and pycharm and requires no further setup after installation. The optimization recommendations are provided to you in a form of suggestions displayed next to a specific line of code. These suggestions can be addressed at any time, they can be reviewed before applying and can be applied or dismissed with a single click.

## Example

When presented with a fragment of code as given below:

```python
arr = []
for i in range(10):
	for j in range(50):
		arr.append([i, j])
```

Sourcery suggests changing it to:

```python
arr = [[i, j] for i, j in itertools.product(range(10), range(50))]
```

I this case, using a  list comprehension and pythons built-in iterator tool allow the interpreter to execute the code
