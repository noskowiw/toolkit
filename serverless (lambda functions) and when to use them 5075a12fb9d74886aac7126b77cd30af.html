</p><p id="b8a9aadd-c235-44c2-afda-09b97f2f5022" class="">serverless functions allow you to run processes without a need to provision any resources. This allows you to avoid under provisioning resources, because all of the computing is being done in a single large scalable server that is being maintained by cloud providers. </p><p id="249f0182-7396-46f7-a57f-c629ee70837a" class="">Lambda functions are not always the best option thou. They are inherently stateless, meaning that if a function needs to load a large file from memory it’s going to have to do it every time it’s run. That is significantly less efficient than performing this calculation on a individually provisioned server, where this data can be kept alive in memory</p><p id="c0ddcd02-150d-4555-b942-601ecf418921" class="">
