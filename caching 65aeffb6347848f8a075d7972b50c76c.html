Sometimes, calling processes that require a lot of computation is inevitable - some values depend so strongly on the state of the application that they need to be computed from scratch every time. However, in a plethora of cases, the result returned by a function call, database query, or an API call is largely dependent on the input given to the process. In those cases, the energy efficiency of the program can be greatly improved by implementing a caching mechanisms.</p><p id="f66f448d-c09b-41a9-bf7b-3b6bad126fd4" class="">in it’s simplest form caching is storing the result of the process in a memory and keeping it accessible to the rest of the application. If the same input is given again, the program can simply read the result from memory instead of calling the process again. This can greatly reduce the amount of computation the program requires in order to be executed efficiently. </p><p id="2f0b9300-2c45-4fc4-adf8-643c422d2bfe" class="">For functions or processes whose output is solely dependent on the input provided a simple memoization algorithm - most likely a hashmap matching input parameters with function output - provides a sufficient enough caching mechanism.</p><p id="dfaaa938-d10f-44d4-a869-25935bb56270" class="">In cases where the output of the process can change with time, but the timescale to consider is relatively large (eg. an API providing data that changes on hourly basis) a caching mechanism with a time-based invalidation policy can be used </p><p id="3a592046-c2fa-43c0-8c5c-75dc48909b6b" class="">There are plenty of caching mechanisms to choose from, each of which is best suited for a different type of problem.

In most cases they work by implementing a creating abstraction on top of your existing code (such as a decorator or a wrapper). so incorporating them into your codebase requires close to no refactoring.</p><p id="aea44e1a-655c-4b28-931a-e9a122ad3cc1" class="">
