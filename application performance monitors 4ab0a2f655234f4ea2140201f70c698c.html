They track and analyze various metrics, such as response time, throughput, and error rate, and display them in a comprehensible manner. By monitoring these metrics you can identify resource intensive elements and inefficiencies of your application, allowing you to focus on the parts of the architecture that will benefit the most from refactoring. This information can be used to optimize the application and improve its overall performance. Aside from performance benefits these improvements can greatly increase the energy efficiency of your application</p><p id="a48b1e1d-bed7-4a82-8f64-fb2538e3ffe5" class="">
